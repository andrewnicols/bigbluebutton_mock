# BigBlueButton Mock API Server

This project and associated docker containers provide a mock of the main BigBlueButton server and can be used for
testing of BigBlueButton integrations.

## Quick setup using Docker
Run the following command to get your mock server up and running:
   ```
   docker run -p 8001:80 moodlehq/bigbluebutton_mock
   ```

## Example usage
### Automated tests
You need to define `TEST_MOD_BIGBLUEBUTTONBN_MOCK_SERVER` in your config.php when running automated tests like PHPUnit and Behat. 
Otherwise, most of the BigBlueButton tests will be marked skipped.

For example, add the following to your config.php after the `$CFG->wwwroot` line:
   ```
   define('TEST_MOD_BIGBLUEBUTTONBN_MOCK_SERVER', "http://localhost:8001/hash" . sha1($CFG->wwwroot));
   ```

### Moodle Docker
The [Moodle Docker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker) testing environment contains in-built support for running and
configuring the mock server (since [#241](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker/pull/241)).

In order to do so, simply export the `MOODLE_DOCKER_BBB_MOCK` environment variable prior to starting the containers.

## More information
All endpoints must be prefixed with a serverID to allow for parallel runs, for example:

```
http://localhost:8001/someServerID/api
```

In addition to the standard endpoints, additional endpoints are provided for setting up data which a test requires or expects:
```
/backoffice/createMeeting
/backoffice/createRecording
```

In addition, the following endpoint can be used to trigger a reset between tests:
```
/backoffice/reset
```

And the following endpoints exist to view the current meetings and recordings:
```
/backoffice/meetings
/backoffice/recordings
```
